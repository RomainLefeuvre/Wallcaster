# Rappel des besoins et des éléments principaux de la solution

Our solution consist of a software and a hardware part. The software part is a web application that will be used to configure the content to display dynamically. The hardware part are multiples RaspberryPi devices that are connected to the monitors to display the selected content.

From a software point of view, we have the following services:
- Backend server retrieving posts from different social networks by applying behavioral filters and ban words filters
- Frontend client displaying posts on different screens linked to a RaspberryPi
- Frontend administrator providing the configuration that the backend must take.

# Estimation (planning, ressources) et description du déroulement du projet (démarche, jalons, outils, réunions)

For the progress of the project, we use the agile project management method using a Kanban (directly accessible via the github project) to define the tasks of the current sprint. In addition, a meeting (daily) is held at each start of TP in order to agree on the progress of tasks. Finally, at the end of each TP, another meeting is held to distribute any tasks that we can advance before the next lab session.
