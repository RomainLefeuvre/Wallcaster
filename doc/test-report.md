# Test Report for Wallcaster App

## Introduction

The purpose of this test report is to provide an overview of the testing conducted on the backend of the Wallcaster app. The main focus of the testing was on the backend functionality, as it is the most critical part of the project. Unit testing was performed using Jest with an instance of the main class "App". Front-end testing was excluded from the scope of this project as it was deemed simple enough and not time-worthy for the project's scale.

## Testing Approach

The testing approach adopted for the Wallcaster app backend was unit testing. Unit testing is a testing technique that involves testing individual units of code in isolation to ensure their functionality meets the expected requirements. Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework, was used to conduct the unit testing on the backend code.

## Test Scope

The scope of testing was limited to the backend of the Wallcaster app, which is responsible for handling various functionalities such as user authentication, data retrieval and storage, API communication, and other server-side operations. The backend code was thoroughly tested to ensure that it is robust, reliable, and meets the expected requirements.

## Test Results

The unit testing conducted on the backend code using Jest yielded positive results. All the tests were passed successfully, indicating that the backend code is functioning as expected and meeting the defined requirements. The tests covered different scenarios, including positive and negative test cases, edge cases, and boundary conditions, to ensure comprehensive testing of the backend functionality.

## Test Findings

During the testing process, no major issues or defects were identified in the backend code. However, a few minor issues were found and addressed during the testing process, such as minor logic errors and data handling discrepancies. These issues were fixed promptly, and retesting was conducted to ensure their resolution.

## Conclusion

Based on the testing conducted, it can be concluded that the backend of the Wallcaster app has been thoroughly tested and is functioning as expected. The unit testing using Jest has helped identify and address minor issues, ensuring that the backend code is robust and reliable. However, it is important to note that front-end testing was not conducted as part of this project, and further testing may be required to ensure the overall quality and functionality of the app.

## Recommendations

Based on the testing conducted, the following recommendations are provided for further improvement of the Wallcaster app:

- Consider conducting comprehensive front-end testing to ensure the quality and functionality of the app's user interface.
- Continue to perform regular regression testing to catch any potential issues that may arise in the future.
- Conduct thorough security testing to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities in the backend code.
- Consider incorporating automated testing techniques, such as integration testing and end-to-end testing, to further improve the overall testing coverage of the app.
