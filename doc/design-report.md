# Sprint 0

During this sprint 0, we defined the bases of the project in order to agree on the solution envisaged to the problem.
For this we started by analyzing the system and the different interactions with the actors using use case diagram and user stories.
Secondly, we detailed the architecture that our project will take using component and deployment diagrams. Then, we specified each service by a class diagram and a corresponding sequence diagram. We have also defined the development and project management tools that we will use throughout the project.
Finally, the last part of this sprint was devoted to the creation of a prototype of the project in order to present it to the product owner.

# Sprint 1

Sprint 1 is the beginning of our project development and implementation. We have chosen many user stories that define the set of functionalities of our product. It will be shown to our customers at the end of the sprint. We will deduce other tasks to do and also the way to test and and check what whe have created. They will be implemented the next weeks. In the end we will obtain a second version of our product, more valuable than before.
The sprint review and the retrospective will allow us to check our progress and define new actions to achieve during sprint 2 and to identify the good or bad manners there have been, in order to fix them if necessary.
