# Sprint 0

During this sprint 0, we defined the bases of the project in order to agree on the solution envisaged to the problem.
For this we started by analyzing the system and the different interactions with the actors using use case diagram and user stories.
Secondly, we detailed the architecture that our project will take using component and deployment diagrams. Then, we specified each service by a class diagram and a corresponding sequence diagram. We have also defined the development and project management tools that we will use throughout the project.
Finally, the last part of this sprint was devoted to the creation of a prototype of the project in order to present it to the product owner.
