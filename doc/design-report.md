# Sprint 0

During this sprint 0, we defined the bases of the project to agree on the solution envisaged for the problem. For this, we started by analyzing the system and the different interactions with the actors using a use case diagram and user stories.
Secondly, we detailed the architecture that our project will take using component and deployment diagrams. Then, we specified each service by a class diagram and a corresponding sequence diagram. We have also defined the development and project management tools that we will use throughout the project.
Finally, the last part of this sprint was devoted to the creation of a prototype of the project to present to the product owner.

## Expected Outcome

- Finish the analysis report
- Documentation of the project structure
  - Choose the technologies
  - Global structure
- Set up the project work environment
  - git
  - CI
  - collaboration
  - tools

Sprint 0 ends Tuesday **06/01/2023**.

# Sprint 1

Sprint 1 is the beginning of our project development and implementation. We have chosen many user stories that define the set of functionalities of our product. It will be shown to our customers at the end of the sprint. We will deduce other tasks to do and also the way to test and check what we have created. They will be implemented in the next weeks. In the end, we will obtain a second version of our product, more valuable than before.
The sprint review and the retrospective will allow us to check our progress and define new actions to achieve during sprint 2 and identify the good or bad manners there have been, to fix them if necessary.
