# Risks encountered and countermeasures to mitigate

During sprint 0, we didn't know how to work with the configuration of the raspberry, both to connect to the wifi and to open the web browser in fullscreen.
Being able to test would have helped to complete the analysis report, for the system sequence diagram.

# Lessons learned, best practices

## Retrospective (02/14/2023)

`The good points` :

- Final product finished in time with most of the wanted features.
- Good estimation of the time needed for each task.
- Use of docker to facilitate development.
- Roles well defined (each person always had something to do)

`The bad points` :

- Integration of the complicated filters just before the end.
- The merge of the work of each person was more complicated than expected, bad estimation of time.

`The neutral points` :

- Reorganisation 

Réorganisation de l'architecture du projet (déplacement de la partie filtre dans un projet externe en Python) après conversation avec les products owners.

Points importants à retenir :

- Etre plus prévoyant, mieux anticiper les temps de fusion de chaque travail.

## Retrospective (03/28/2023)

- this is the end of sprint 2
- we previously planned to finish sprint 2 in 5 weeks but we finished it in about 3 weeks.
- we didn´t planned the time well and finished early
- this is why we added some extra features to sprint 2.
- this led to a lot of work in the last week since everything had to be done in a short time for the demo of the product. (like the photo implementation) 
- we had to rethink the AI filter and decided to scrap it for a new a more performant filter for the next sprint.
